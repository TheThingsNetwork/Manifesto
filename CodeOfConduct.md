# The Things Network Community Code of Conduct

## Community Values

These are the values to which people in community of The Things Stack should aspire.

* Be friendly and welcoming.
* Be patient.
  - Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.
* Be thoughtful.
  - Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
  - Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
* Be respectful.
  - In particular, respect differences of opinion.
* Be charitable.
  - Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
  - When we do disagree, try to understand why.
* Be constructive.
  - Avoid derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
  - Avoid unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer -- or at least solicit -- suggestions as to how things may be improved.
  - Avoid snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments).
  - Avoid discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
  - Avoid microaggressions (brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group).
* Be responsible.
  - What you say and do matters. Take responsibility for your words and actions, including their consequences, whether intended or otherwise.

People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of all parties to de-escalate conflict when it arises.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

  address, without their explicit permission

## Enforcement Responsibilities

acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.
